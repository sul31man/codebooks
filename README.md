These files contain scripts for generating the curve for theorem 1 in the paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8006984

The file named theorem1.py is the most accurate iteration thus far, including both functions q(t) and p(t). This takes a lot of time to run due to the large number of combinations required for 
the Monte Carlo simulation of the It rv.
